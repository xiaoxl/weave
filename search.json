    "text": "1.1 Program Learning Outcomes: Knowledge of Mathematics\nStudents will demonstrate an understanding of calculus, linear algebra, and other areas of mathematics. Courses that this PLO can be assessed: Calculus I, II, and III, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Introduction to Analysis, Linear Algebra, Abstract Algebra, Mathematical Modeling and Senior Seminar (MATH 2914, 2924, 2934, 3243, 3203, 4003, 4033, 4123, 4971)\n\n1.1.1 Measure: Pretest\n\n1.1.1.1 Expectations/Target for this Outcome (1)\nThe pretest is given at the beginning of the semester, before any material is covered. All questions are multiple choice questions, therefore whether the correctness of each question is objective.\n\nEXPECTATIONS/TARGET FOR THIS OUTCOME: There are no expectations for the pretest. The results are used to be compared with results from the posttest.\nImprovement(s) achieved This is a baseline assessment of the students’s knowledge before instruction and learning takes place in the course.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Measure Posttest\n\n1.1.2.1 Expectations/Target for this Outcome (1)\nThe posttest is given during the semester, with the majority part being blended into the final exam at the end of the semester. All the scores are recorded and paired with the results from the pretest. The matched-pair t-Test is applied.\n\nEXPECTATIONS/TARGET FOR THIS OUTCOME We expect to see that from the matched pair t-Test the increase of scores from pretest to posttest for each individuals within each whole class is statistically significant.\nFINDINGS/RESULTS 2021: For MATH2914, 2924, 2934, 3243, the mean pretest score is lower than the mean posttest score based on a p-value of less than 0.0001. Therefore there is quite a significant increase in the learning acquired by our students in these four courses.\nREFLECTION ON FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT STEPS 2021; Currently we only record the total score of pretest/posttest. We may record the correctness of each individual questions of each students for us to get more information on students learning."
